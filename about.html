    <h1>About Quarm Investments, LLC</h1>
    <p>Quarm Investments, LLC is more than a real estate company — it’s a movement for equitable development and sustainable transformation. Based in North Liberty, Iowa, we were founded in 2025 to address the urgent housing needs of underserved communities across the state.</p>

    <h2>Our Origin</h2>
    <p>Our story began with three individuals from different backgrounds — a finance expert, a field operator, and a strategic technician — who shared a common frustration: watching Iowa’s housing stock deteriorate while local families struggled to find affordable, dignified homes. Together, we created Quarm Investments to do something about it. Today, we are 33.33% minority-owned and driven by a mission to uplift communities, one property at a time.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p><em>To revitalize underserved neighborhoods through strategic real estate investment — creating high-quality housing, empowering underrepresented communities, and delivering long-term value to our investors and the families we serve.</em></p>

    <h2>Leadership Team</h2>
